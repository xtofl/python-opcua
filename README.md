API is similar to the python bindings of freeopcua C++ client and servers. It offers both a low level interface to send and receive all UA defined structures and high level classes allowing to write a server or a client in a few lines.

Most code is autogenerated from xml specification using same code as the one that is used for freeopcua C++ client and server, thus adding missing functionality to client and server should be trivial.

Using Python > 3.4 the server and client do not require any third party libraries. If using python 2.7 or pypy < 3 you need to install enum34, trollius(asyncio), and futures(concurrent.futures), with pip for example. Server and client can be run with pypy.

coveryage.py reports a test coverage of over 90% of code, most of the rest is autogenerated code that is not used yet.

Soe documentation is available at http://python-opcua.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Client: what works:
* connection to server, opening channel, session
* browsing and reading attributes value
* gettings nodes by path and nodeids
* creating subscriptions
* subscribing to items for data change
* subscribing to events
* adding nodes
* method call

Tested servers: freeopcua C++, freeopcua Python, prosys


Client: what is not implemented yet 
* removing nodes 
* adding missing modify methods
* certificate handling
* user and password 

Server: what works:
* creating channel and sessions
* read/set attributes and browse
* gettings nodes by path and nodeids
* autogenerate addres space from spec
* adding nodes to address space
* datachange events
* events
* methods

Tested clients: freeopcua C++, freeopcua Python, uaexpert, prosys, quickopc

Server: what is not implemented
* security (users, certificates, etc)
* removing nodes 
* adding missing modify methods

Example client code:

```
from opcua import ua, Client

class SubHandler(object):
    def data_change(self, handle, node, val, attr):
        print("Python: New data change event", handle, node, val, attr)

    def event(self, handle, event):
        print("Python: New event", handle, event)

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    client = Client("opc.tcp://localhost:4841/freeopcua/server/")
    client.connect()
    
    root = client.get_root_node()

    #getting a variable by path and setting its value attribute
    myvar = root.get_child(["0:Objects", "2:NewObject", "2:MyVariable"])
    var.set_value(ua.Variant([23], ua.VariantType.Int64))
    
    #subscribing to data change event to our variable
    handler = SubHandler()
    sub = client.create_subscription(500, handler)
    sub.subscribe_data_change(myvar)
    
    time.sleep(100)

    client.disconnect()
```

Example server code:

```
    from opcua import ua, Server

    server = Server()
    
    server.set_endpoint("opc.tcp://localhost:4841/freeopcua/server/")
    server.set_server_name("FreeOpcUa Example Server")
    uri = "http://examples.freeopcua.github.io"
    idx = server.register_namespace(uri)
    objects = server.get_objects_node()
    myfolder = objects.add_folder(idx, "myfolder")
    myvar = myfolder.add_variable(idx, "myvar", 6.7)

    # creating an event object
    myevent = server.get_event_object(ObjectIds.BaseEventType)
    myevent.Message.Text = "This is my event"
    myevent.Severity = 300
    
    server.start()
    myevent.trigger()
    ...
```

# Development

Code follows PEP8 apart for line lengths and autogenerate class and enums that keep camel case from XML definition.

## Running tests:

```
python tests.py
```

## Coverage

```
coverage run tests.py  
coverage html  
firefox htmlcov/index.html  
```
